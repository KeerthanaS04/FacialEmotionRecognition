– Developed a Facial Emotion Recognition model utilizing Convolutional layers, Separable Conv2D, and
Batch Normalization techniques, with an accuracy of **89%**
– Conducted rigorous testing of various datasets with different pre-trained models, demonstrating that
my **custom-built model outperformed the accuracy of pre-trained models**.
– Implemented advanced techniques such as Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and Local Binary Patterns
(LBP) to enhance facial features recognition, further improving the overall performance of the model.
– Achieved significant advancements in Facial Emotion Recognition by combining cutting-edge methodologies and
optimizing the model architecture.

Additionally, developed a Emotion Recognition captured in Live(with another model).
