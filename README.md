#FacialEmotionRecognition #CNN #imageProcessing

I've been working on facial emotion recognition and have also incorporated music recommendations based on the mood detected. Additionally, I've created my own model that's been performing better than pre-trained models in terms of accuracy. It's been a fun challenge and I'm excited to see how it can be applied in various fields.
